## Submission extras for Bots

Bots in Microsoft Teams must be built and registered in the Bot Framework.  Teams pulls some information from the Bot Framework to display to end users, so you must ensure you provide the following information on the Bot Framework Dev Portal as well as in the Teams Manifest.

On your bot portal page, click the Publish button.  In this dialog there are several required fields that you must enter:
* Icon - you should use your color 96x96 icon
* Privacy statent - must match the Privacy Link URL you provide in your manifest and Seller Dashboard
* Terms of Use - must match the Terms of service URL you provide in your manifest

Fill in the above and hit **Save**.  Please Note: there is no requirement to Publish the bot to the Bot Framework Bot Directory.
