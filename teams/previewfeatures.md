# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

The following are available to users of the Public Developer Preview ring. See [What is the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams?](publicpreview.md) for more information on enabling it for your development tenant.

The following features are available in the Public Developer Preview as of August 25, 2017.

## Apps in Microsoft Teams

Apps in Microsoft Teams allow you to make your service available to users through a single Teams App package, which includes bots, tabs, connectors and compose extensions. Learn more [here](index.md). 
  
## Discover Apps gallery 

The Discover Apps gallery provides a listing of all apps available in Microsoft Teams spanning various categories. Developers can get apps in here by [submitting their apps to the Office Store](submission.md).  
  
## Compose extensions

Compose extensions make it easy for users to query for information from your service and post them into conversations in the form of rich cards. Learn more [here](composeextensions.md).
   
## App notifications 

App notifications allow apps to send messages using the Bot Framework without having to implement a conversational bot. It also enables them to mark messages as important and to post messages to the activity feed. Learn more [here](activityfeed.md).
 
## Actionable connectors

Actionable connectors use the new Actionable Message card type within Microsoft Teams that allow users to interact with connector cards. Learn more [here](connectors.md). 
 
## Bot message updates

Bot messages can be updated after they have been delivered, enabling apps to always show up-to-date state in their messages as new information becomes available. Learn more [here](botsconversation.md#updating-messages).
